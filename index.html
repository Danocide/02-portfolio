                <div class="div">
                    <p>At 18, in 2015 I started a grand journey by enlisting in the United States Navy. Leaving my home in Florida to go to Great Lakes Illinois to attend
                     Bootcamp in January of 2015 I spent 2 months learning the many different skills required to be a member of the Military.
                     After completing Bootcamp in February I remained in the Great Lakes ares for 6 months as I learned and perfected my craft, completing A school and
                      becoming an Interior Communications Electrician and also being promoted to the rank of E-4, becoming a Petty Officer Third Class.
                      My journey through the many different schools provided to me to become an outstanding technician did not end there. I was provided an additional "C" school 
                      to learn how to work on a specific system called Fiber Optics Data Multiplexing System or FODMS for short. After not only completing my school but being given multiple 
                      student of the week awards and finishing my C school as the top student I was finally on my way to my chosen ship, the USS McCampbell DDG-85 stationed in Yokosuka Japan.
                      I arrived at my new command in October of 2015, quickly having to not only get used to a foreign land but also to a new way of life. I wanted to make a name for myself as
                      being a technician that you could trust to fix the problem when called upon so I threw myself into my craft. All throughout my C school we were told by our instructor to not
                      waste our time worrying about small repeated faults that came up within our system because nobody was able to get a FODMS system without faults, there would always be faults within
                      our system that didnt have an impact on the normal day to day operation but would appear no matter what we did. Being stubborn and with something to prove I decided to take that as a
                      challenge and devoted my time to having the perfect system. After 6 months of constant troubleshooting and repairing small issues I had done it, I had the only 0 fault FODMS system 
                      in the entire navy. After 3 years spent with the USS McCampbell it was finally my time to leave and I was finally able to go back to America, being stationed this time in San Diego California
                      at the largest military hospital NMCSD. There my responsabilities were to secure and destroy computers and medical information that contained sensative information realating
                      to patients and faculty. For another 3 years this was my job until finally I was on the way out of the navy, on December 21st 2020 I was finally making my way back home after 6 long years.
                      I had a lot of thinking to do for what the future held for me, I finally made the decision to try and break my way into a new way of life by enrolling in the UCF coding bootcamp to get
                      get started in my new career.
